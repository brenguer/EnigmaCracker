This Python package is a lightweight implementation of the historic Enigma machine for encrypting and decrypting messages. After exploring existing projects, I decided to take on the challenge of building my own version from scratch.

It proudly answers a question few dared to ponder:
"How can I frustrate my friends with cryptic, trivial messages while making them experience the thrill of historical codebreaking?"

Completely standalone, EnigmaPy requires no external dependencies for decryption and is open for use, modification, and customization under the MIT license.
